  One of Buckminster Fuller's earliest inventions was a car shaped like a blimp.
  The car had three wheels-two up front, one in the back-and a periscope instead
  of a rear window. Owing to its unusual design, it could be maneuvered into a
  parking space nose first and could execute a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn so
  tightly that it would end up practically where it had started, facing the
  opposite direction.
